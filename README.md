An  unprivileged (in case of unprivileged user namespaces enabled, otherwise needs namespaced CAP_SYS_ADMIN privilege) local user able to open a  filesystem that does not support the Filesystem Context API (and thus  fallbacks to legacy handling) could use this flaw to escalate their  privileges on the system.
